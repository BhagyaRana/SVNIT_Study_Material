<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<p>This <a class="plain" href="#">link will not be underlined</a>,
  as links generally are by default. Be careful when removing
  the text decoration on anchors since users often depend on
  the underline to denote hyperlinks.</p>
