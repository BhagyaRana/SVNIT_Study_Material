      <p><img src="smily.jfif" width="24" height="39" alt="Stickman"> - Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".</p>

<p><a href="nature.jfif">HTML base tag</a> - Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
